SAS advanced license Thesis/Dissertation Projects: A. Time: from 2014 January to 2014 Match Title: the relationship between the mathematical grade of the seventh grade and grades from primary school. Brief process: use linear model to fit transformed variables from the data after getting rid of useless columns, choose the most significant variables to form the final model based on persuasive diagnostic values. Achievements from the project:the mathematical grade of the seventh grade is significantly influenced by the reading, counting and logistic ability at the first and second grade in the primary school. B. Time: from 2014 May to 2014 August Title:bike rental prediction Brief process: construct the regression model use different statistical method, find the most powerful model decided by finding the least error rate, and decide which variables significantly enough to build the model. Achievements from the project: use Lasso to make the regression, it gives the least error rate and use the almost original data set, it saves a lot of time to deal with the original data set. C. Time:from 2014 September to October Title: Classify Song Release Period Brief process: construct the classification model to classify a specific song into the year before or after the year 1986 based on 90 attributes of a single song and 6480 songs. Achievements from the project: use the Multivariate adaptive regression splines to build the model and based on the final classification model, we can conclude that if the song is from before or after on 1986 depends mostly on the artists who create them, secondly on properties they tagged by famous music website and finally on properties of their track. D. Time: from 2014 November to 2014 December Title: predict the lightening strikes in July based on the records from January to June. Brief process: first cluster the original data based on the lightening strike records and the moisture records with the method of K-mean and Hierarchical method. Second use different statistical method like Boosting, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso, NNET, CART, SVM to find the best model to predict the strikes will happen. Achievements from the project: we use the K-mean clustering method and based on the moisture data to form the cluster and use the neural network is a better way for our prediction to get a smaller MSE, and lightning strike have direct relationship with the soil moisture level and the climate indices. E. Time: from 2014 November to 2014 December Title: predict the daily stock price of Netflix Inc. Based on historical daily price records. Brief process: use GARCH model to fit the transformed data and finally choose the GARCH plus ARMAR model to make the forecasting.

The batches feed daily IDOCs from CBS located on SAP environment to S&D IW located on MVS/DB2 environment through FODS (Fulfillment Operational Data Store). The LDW ESW is physically located on an MVS/DB2 environment in UK/Portsmouth - UK MVS TSOBA. There will be no direct access to the LDW ESW system on TSOBA for the common users (key users and LCM have direct access). Edge-On-Demand is used as a front-end tool with BRIO as the query tool behind. It's a WEB based solution, which supports different formats (BRIO, HTML, and L123). PROJECT: LDS (LEGACY DATA SYSTEMS) Developer Oct 2007 - Mar 2009 Client : IBM, Germany Platform : Z/OS. Tools : Spufi, QMF, Brio, DB2, TSO/ISPF Team Size : 2 Roles / Responsibilities: Responsible Application design. Production Support. Creating Report on BRIO depending on Requirements. Scheduling the jobs in OPC. DBA Activities. Participate in project meeting. Description: The Legacy Data Store (LDS) as a logical part of the EDW consists of 12 tables. It is a system which receives data from the Legacy Warehouse systems and stores it in the S&D Information Warehouse. The whole transmission system consists of two parts: 1) The sending part on Legacy Warehouse Country side 2) The receiving part on S&D IW side For each sending system exists in the S&D IW one dedicated receiving System. The sending and the receiving systems are developed as OPC job net running under MVS. Each job net consists of several jobs, which usually executes one program, but there are also jobs executing more than one. A program is a MVS/DB2 Utility or a PL/I Program. Because up to 12 tables are fed, there are also 12 interfaces, each responsible for one target table. Dependent from the target table, every interface has a specific layout and record format. The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file. This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side. If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.

{"text": "CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER Summary of Skills Strategic Planning/Management Strong communication skills Strong credit/financial analysis skills Team builder/collaborator Sales management Negotiation skills Strong multi-tasker Project management Planning/execution Cross Functional leadership Professional Experience Chief Operating Officer June 2008 to January 2010 Company Name - City , State Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO. Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees. Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014. This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment. Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to poor performance. Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009. Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total. Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for each topic and rules of order. Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative. This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective. Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the treatment of various types of cancer). Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually. Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board. One was amicable and the other was contentious. This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually. May 1998 to May 2008 Company Name - City , State COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID. Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 05/1998 Through aggressive sales calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! This was accomplished with a consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank. Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking Manager 06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to Longview, WA. While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint. I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence. Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged environment. At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County). Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to existing customers. This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually. Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and existing clients. I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in business development and instrumental in our success. Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member. June 2005 As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee. This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented. In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.
